## Week Two homework assignment 
This is a responsive portolio page. It has a section describing who I am, a recent image of myself, body of work and a contact section. This was a very challenging assignment for me as i didnt have demo code to go by. After many many hours, I am pleased with the result for now. I am hopeful this version meets the required criterias of the assignment. I hope to update this page as i learn more styles and tricks with CSS, Javascript, Jquery and React in the future. This page will serve as my profesional portfolio when i am ready to search for a job.
