# profesional-portfolio
## Week Two homework assignment 
 https://sanawck.github.io/profesional-portfolio/
 
This is a responsive portolio page. It has a section describing who I am, a recent image of myself, body of work and a contact section. This was a very challenging assignment for me. I didnt have a demo code to go by. After many many hours, I am pleased with the result for now. I am hopeful this version meets the required criterias of the assignment. I do not have any work so far so i have no real image of my work yet. I hope to update this page as i learn more styles and tricks with CSS, Javascript, Jquery and React in the future. This page will serve as my profesional portfolio when i am ready to search for a job. 

The below are the criterias i am hoping to meet with this assignment.

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
